"""Learning's local store: ``learning.db`` and ``learning/blobs/`` in the data folder.

- **Created only when Learning is turned on** (the first enable, :meth:`LearningStore.create`)
  or by the first write while it is on. Never by a read, never while Learning is off, never
  at import. While Learning is off nothing new is recorded: episodes, decisions, signals and
  blobs are refused. Maintenance on data that is already there (deletion purges, lesson
  marks, delete-all) still works, because turning Learning off keeps the data.
- **One SQLite file**, WAL, ``secure_delete`` on so purged rows are overwritten. Every
  operation opens and closes its own connection under one process lock, so no handle
  stays open (Windows can then remove the file) and writes never interleave.
- **Every record** from ``contracts`` is kept as its canonical JSON with a few indexed
  columns, plus link tables: which conversations own a record (``owners``), which it was
  derived from (``derivations``), its parents (``lineage``, for the archive of attempts and
  for releases) and the blobs it names (``blob_refs``).
- **Blobs** are SHA-256 addressed files, written atomically (a temp file, then a replace),
  deduplicated, and reference counted by the records naming them. Purges free the ones
  nothing references; :meth:`LearningStore.gc_blobs` also sweeps leftovers.
- **Every blob belongs to its chat** (P2). A model call's request names its messages, tools
  and pictures only inside its manifest blob (and a past chat's request its conversation's
  blob), so writing the decision records those blobs as the conversation's (``blob_owners``,
  one row per blob per conversation). Deleting or opting out the conversation frees them
  once no other conversation or record holds them. A one-off sweep
  (:meth:`LearningStore.sweep_orphans`) records the owners of what earlier builds wrote and
  removes blobs nothing references any more (counts only).
- **Pictures** (``pictures``) are blobs of their own, named by the messages they were in. Past
  :data:`PICTURE_CAP_BYTES` the oldest go first, never one a vault task's decision used; the
  decision and its text stay, and the picture is marked dropped.
- **Deleting or excluding a conversation** purges what it owns (episodes, decisions,
  signals, replay fixtures and their unreferenced blobs) and *marks* the lessons, releases,
  attempts and test runs derived from it (``source_chat_deleted`` / ``source_chat_excluded``)
  instead of deleting them, so a later version can offer "Retrain without it". It also
  reaches the audit vault (``learning/audit.db``, E10): the conversation's hidden tasks
  leave it, and "Delete learning data" removes the vault.
- **Held-out decisions**: the audit vault marks the decisions it holds (``held_out``);
  training data and drafting leave them out (:meth:`LearningStore.held_out_ids`).
- **Schema migrations** are versioned with ``PRAGMA user_version``; a store from a newer app
  is refused rather than changed.
