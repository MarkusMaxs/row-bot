"""Computer use as tools: ``computer`` (look at and work in an app) and ``computer_record`` (a video).

``computer`` is one small tool. Each action says in a line what it did, then
names the window and lists its controls with their positions; a model that
sees images also gets the window's picture right after the result
(``browser.model_view``), and checks it itself. Coordinates are in that
picture. Errors say what went wrong and how to fix it.
