"""Row-Bot asks the person questions with options, in a card (N4).

``ask_person`` pauses the turn on the same path as an approval: a LangGraph
``interrupt()`` of kind ``question``, an ``approval_requests`` row, a card in
the conversation (or a channel's buttons and numbered replies), and the
person's answer resumes the turn.

An answer is the person's input, never an approval:

- it resumes only the question's own interrupt (by its id), so an action
  waiting beside it in the same step still asks for its own approval;
- an answer is a mapping, and approvals go ahead only on ``True``;
- the Auto reviewer, "approve the rest" and Hands-off never answer a
  question: it is not a permission, so every level still asks;
- an unattended workflow waits like an approval step; at the step's timeout
  the agent is told to go with its recommended option, and a question with
  none stops the run ("No answer in time").

The answer is validated against the question's own options on the server
(``answer``) and again by the tool when the turn resumes.
