"""Several X accounts, each named on everything Row-Bot does with it (N7).

Every connected X account signs in with the person's own X app and keeps its sign-in in its own
keychain slot, ``x:<user ID>`` (``account_tokens``). What isn't secret, its numeric ID, handle and
display name, is listed in ``x/accounts.json`` in the data folder, in the order the accounts were
added. Tokens never leave the keychain: they are never returned, logged or shown.

There is no "current account". A tool call names its account, and with more than one connected a
write that doesn't is refused with the list (``resolve``).

Before 5.3 there was one X sign-in, in the slot ``x``. ``migrate`` makes it the first account: its
handle and ID are read once from X (``/2/users/me``), the token is saved in its own slot and read
back, the account is listed, and only then is the old slot removed. Until then the old sign-in
stays readable; the next check, sign-in or tool call tries again.
