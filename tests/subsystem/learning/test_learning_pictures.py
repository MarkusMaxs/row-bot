"""Pictures kept for the long run (P2, O128): 5.3's page picture after a browser or computer action is stored
as its own bytes, once, read back exactly as the model saw it, never touched by redaction, and kept within a
size cap that never drops a vault task's picture. A8: every arm is asked in the shape it is served (a text-only
arm without the picture, as training leaves it out; a vision arm with it), the vault keeps the picture, and a
task's text is the person's words. These run in the pull-request lane."""
